# Starkey
Starkey is a programming language in development that is all about making data science, informatics, and other data-processing projects easier, safer, and more deliberate.

## About the Project
Starkey is being developed by one person (hello! :D) and has a timeline of multiple years. The hope and goal is to develop the language and implement features as I learn grow further into my career and learn more about the fields and best practices.

The project has its roots all the way back to November 2023. I've always wanted to make a programming language because like a normal language, it's the fundamental framework of how we communicate with computers (like we communicate with people)

## What's in This Documentation?
You'll find some of my very opinionated ideas for Starkey along with some actual documentation once the implementation starts to get there. You'll also find a journal which has my thoughts about everything as I develop the language.
